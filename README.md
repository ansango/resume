<h1 align="center">My resume ðŸ‘‹</h1>

### Hi there!

This is my personal resume, it is developed in NuxtJS and TailwindCSS and deployed in Netlify.

It has obtained a 100% performance in Google's Lighthose.

Feel free to fork and reuse the project.

$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
